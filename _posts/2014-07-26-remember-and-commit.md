> If only we could remember who God is; then we could more easily commit to following Him with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength.

The Bible is so powerful. Its words can literally change your life in an instant. Why are these words so powerful?

- It's Truth about who you are.
- It's Truth about where you're from.
- It's Truth about where you're going.
- It's Truth about your purpose.
- It's Truth about how God relates to you.
- It's Truth about how life works best.

For a few seconds, imagine your life if you knew beyond any doubt exactly who you were (your gifts, talents, desires, strengths and weaknesses), why you were put on this earth, your origins (how you got where you are today; your history), what God thought of you and how He interacts with you. If those Truths were written on your heart — what would your life be life?

Scripture has all these wonderful things to be written on your hearts but there's a problem.

The Bible is so long! And I have such little time. How would it be possible to intimately know these Truths—as if they were written on your heart?

## The Christian Life: Study, Study, Study

Puke. I graduate college so I wouldn't need to study anymore. There are a handful of people I know who "love to learn;" the friend(s) who kept taking college courses online after they graduated, just for the fun of it. Maybe they would enjoy studying, but I don't.

Some would say, "Well, that's just the life of a Christian—we must be disciplined; we must work hard to learn and maintain the discplines of a Christian walk."

Ok sure, there is a lot of value in discipline, but all the discipline I've learned is _dull_ and _difficult_.

## We Forget

As a result of delicately avoiding the Christian disciplines, we start forgetting—or at least, not bringing to the forefront of our minds as often—the wonderful power in the Truths written in Scripture.

We forget who we are. We forget our purpose. We get distracted in pursuit of our career, keeping up with the Joneses, or keeping up with our friend's life on Facebook. Then, when the hard times inevitably come, we begin searching for these Truths we so desparately need again—that God loves us; His plan is _always_ better than our plan; God has a purpose for you right here, right now.

_If only_ we could remember and recall these Truths. _If only_ they were written on our hearts. We would [not tossed back and forth by the waves or carried about by every wind](http://bibleread.in/?psg=ephesians+4:14), but we could stand firm in the Truths we know.

> If we only _remembered_ God's Truths, then it wouldn't be hard to commit our life to Christ.

Commitment comes easily when you know the Truth—so _remembering_, is the real key to living a Christian lifestyle.

## Start Remembering

How can we start remembering God's Truths? I'm sure you're already familiar with several methods:

- Singing worship songs, especially, from Scripture — e.g. [Shane &amp; Shane](http://shaneandshane.com/)
- Listening to regular teaching — e.g. going to church, or listening to podcasts ([Northside Christian Church](http://northsideccpodcast.podbean.com/) - my home church)
- Daily devotions — e.g. [My Utmost for His Highest](http://www.amazon.com/Utmost-His-Highest-Updated-Edition-ebook/dp/B0049U4WA6)
- Reading plans — e.g. [The B90](http://scriptureawakening.com/b90/)
- Study resources — e.g. [The HarperCollins Study Bible](http://www.amazon.com/HarperCollins-Study-Bible-Student-Edition/dp/0060786841/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1405966290&sr=8-1&keywords=harpercollins+study+bible)
- [Spritual Disciplines for the Christian Life](http://www.amazon.com/Spiritual-Disciplines-Christian-Pilgrimage-Growth/dp/1576830276/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1405966731&sr=8-1&keywords=the+spiritual+disciplines)
- Celebrating Christian/Jewish Holidays — regular rememberences of certain events that happened in the past is a great way to remember God's Truths
- Memorizing Scripture — e.g. [ScriptureTyper](http://scripturetyper.com/)


## Discipline Seems Like No Fun

Above I listed all these resources, but which of them do I myself use? I use too few.

I _want_ to remember God's Truths. So I'm going to find ways to strengthen my memory. I've already done a little research and I'm pretty excited to share with you the things I've found (some stuff that's way more fun the just reading over and over)!

If you're interested in what I find, then [subscribe to my email list](http://eepurl.com/ZqIeT) and I'll email you when I have a new blog post (usually once a week or less).
