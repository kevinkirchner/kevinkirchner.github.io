We access all this info in little viewing portlets called websites. Sometimes they're loosly connected with API's or the like, but you have all these separate pieces. It makes finding the perfect workflow very challenging because, either 1) the things that exist aren't the all-in-one package deal you're looking for, or 2) it's challenging to integrate with the other things that fill in the gaps

So, the problem: disconnected, incomplete, hard/time consuming to extend - bottom line: always 87% of what we really need.

One solution: an opinionated, but stupid simple plugin platform that anyone's mother could code what they want to to get what they want/need to use.

npm or bower may be a good example of this, but there was SO much work involved in getting it to the point it's at and it only has a chance of thriving if everyone accepts it and it reaches the tipping point.

...

I almost feel like you have to reinvent the web as we know it to get past this.

Change what websites are altogether. No html, no screens even. Start from scratch.

The ultimate question that the internet is currently attempting to answer: How can you get everything you want/need in ONE place?

So, simply put, what is internet as we know it currently used for? Is the internet just information? No b/c it's also stores - so you can order things. So you're ordering something, managing (gathering, sharing, creating) information, or being entertained... does that sum up the internet? Seems pretty small if you think about it like that.

Current capabilities of the internet put simply:

- ordering stuff
- managing information
- social
- entertainment

What are all the things we want to access in ONE place?

- Relationships
- Basic needs
- Information
- Entertainment

Hmmm... those seem to correlate pretty closely. But then why does it seem like I'm still missing out when I use the internet all day (working as a web developer).

I just realized that it seems like you can get everything you need in one place _without_ the internet: Family.

A family (can) provide:

- Deep relationships
- Basic needs
- Information — just different than the kind we get off the internet. Information like values, morals, traditions, skills, history, etc.
- Entertainment — if you have kids, you know how little TV you need to be entertained!

So is the internet a big distraction away from the one place we _can_ get everything we need?
