Sharing your location with anyone is really simple:

## 1. Go to the Messages app

## 2. Find the person with whom you'd like to share your location

## 3. Click on "Details" in the top right

If you want, you can set to share your location all the time with your family by default by [setting up Family Sharing](http://www.iphonehacks.com/2014/09/setup-family-sharing-iphone-ipad-ios-8.html).
