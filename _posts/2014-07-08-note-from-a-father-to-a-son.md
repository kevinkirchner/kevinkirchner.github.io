A few days back I read a note to my son. As I read it, I realized I was reading a picture of the father I desired for my son.

I thought I'd share for all the other dads out there trying to be the best dad they can be.

A note every father should read to his sons:

<blockquote class="a-center">
    Listen, my sons, to a father’s instruction;<br>
    pay attention and gain understanding.<br>
    I give you sound learning,<br>
    so do not forsake my teaching.<br><br>
    For I too was a son to my father,<br>
    still tender, and cherished by my mother.<br>
    Then he taught me, and he said to me,<br>
    “Take hold of my words with all your heart;<br>
    keep my commands, and you will live.<br>
    Get wisdom, get understanding;<br>
    do not forget my words or turn away from them.<br>
    Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you;<br>
    love her, and she will watch over you.<br>
    The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom.<br>
    Though it cost all you have, get understanding.<br>
    Cherish her, and she will exalt you;<br>
    embrace her, and she will honor you.<br>
    She will give you a garland to grace your head<br>
    and present you with a glorious crown.”<br><br>
    Listen, my son, accept what I say,<br>
    and the years of your life will be many.<br>
    I instruct you in the way of wisdom<br>
    and lead you along straight paths.<br>
    When you walk, your steps will not be hampered;<br>
    when you run, you will not stumble.<br>
    Hold on to instruction, do not let it go;<br>
    guard it well, for it is your life.<br><br>
    Do not set foot on the path of the wicked<br>
    or walk in the way of evildoers.<br>
    Avoid it, do not travel on it;<br>
    turn from it and go on your way.<br>
    For they cannot rest until they do evil;<br>
    they are robbed of sleep till they make someone stumble.<br>
    They eat the bread of wickedness<br>
    and drink the wine of violence.<br>
    The path of the righteous is like the morning sun,<br>
    shining ever brighter till the full light of day.<br>
    But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness;<br>
    they do not know what makes them stumble.<br><br>
    My son, pay attention to what I say;<br>
    turn your ear to my words.<br>
    Do not let them out of your sight,<br>
    keep them within your heart;<br>
    for they are life to those who find them<br>
    and health to one’s whole body.<br><br>
    Above all else, guard your heart,<br>
    for everything you do flows from it.<br><br>
    Keep your mouth free of perversity;<br>
    keep corrupt talk far from your lips.<br><br>
    Let your eyes look straight ahead;<br>
    fix your gaze directly before you.<br><br>
    Give careful thought to the paths for your feet<br>
    and be steadfast in all your ways.<br>
    Do not turn to the right or the left;<br>
    keep your foot from evil.<br><br>
</blockquote>

Those are challenging words for a son to hear from a father, but perhaps even harder (and _so_ courageous) from a father to a son.

You can tell that was written by the wisest man on Earth... Solomon. You see, that letter is actually [Proverbs, chapter four](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+4).
