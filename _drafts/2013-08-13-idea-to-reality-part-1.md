Imagine.

You just had the Best. Idea. Ever.

â€¦

*Now what? How do you bring an idea to reality?*
 
<br/>

"The Chronicles of Toivo, The Idea Traveler" will take you on some epic (and maybe not-so-epic) journeys on his travels on the road from Idea to Reality. 

Tom Edison put it well, *"Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration."*  And yet it seems like 99% of people have great ideas, but only 1% of them make the journey from Idea to Reality. I'm sure you've had a few great ideas yourself, but making them a reality can be a tough challenge.
