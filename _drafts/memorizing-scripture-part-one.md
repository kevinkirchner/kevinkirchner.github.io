I think few would argue that the Truths in Scripture are not beneficial. Even if you are not a professing Christian, the Bible is [a source for a lot of good wisdom][1]. For believers, God's Word is so importantâ€”yet, rarely do we take the time to memorize it.

I've begun a journey to discovery how to remember God's Word better. [My previous post][2] suggested we could live better lives if we simply remembered who God is. _Memory_ plays a vital role in living a life like Christ.
