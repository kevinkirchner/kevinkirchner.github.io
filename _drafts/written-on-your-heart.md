## The Dreadful Word

Memorize. Bah! I can think of one person I know who likes to memorize. Actually, I don't know if he likes it, I just know he's disciplined enough to do it. That's the other dreadful word, "discipline."

But what if...

What if remembering was easy? What if memorizing was fun? What if we could learn AND recall all the Truths taught to us in the Bible?

Wouldn't our lives be starkly different?
