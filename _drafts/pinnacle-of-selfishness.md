title:  "Is it Selfishness or is it User Experience?"
---

I was just thinking about a better UX for IM'ing — the problem: [order of chats doesn't flow with the convo so you end up with 2 parallel conversations] — solution: [move chats back in place]

But wait — why am i spending all this time on making chat a better experience? Aren't there more important things to be focusing time, effort, and resources on? How about the "user experience" of hungry ugandan orphans? Why not try and figure out ways to make their lives better instead of our own? How selfish have we really gotten.

Have you noticed that we are hiring people to focus on UX (the job that considers how others feel) b/c we are too focused on our bottom line. Sure, we say we want a better product, but the only reason we want a better product is to become the next Apple.
